        <p>
            Hailing from a quaint town 600 km south-west of Addis Ababa, my roots were embedded in simplicity,
             with limited access to electricity and the internet. A spark of passion for software engineering was 
             ignited during a transformative summer camp organized by Jelani Nelson. Despite the challenges of catching 
             up with peers, I embraced the difficulty, recognizing that the road ahead would be far from easy.
              Driven by the desire to expand my skills and elevate my community, my journey is fueled by a commitment 
            to bring my town into the global digital fold.

        <h2>Childhood Memories</h2>

        <p>
            In the heart of the Ethiopian jungle, I, a wild spirit, thrived with no concept of classrooms. 
            Days were an adventure of playing amidst vibrant foliage until a summer camp the summer camp. T
            ransitioning from carefree jungle wanderer to aspiring academician wasn't easy, mirroring the untamed terrain I grew up in. 
            Yet, armed with resilience, I pursued education, becoming a respected figure in my small town. Now, other kids look to me, 
            bridging the gap between the simplicity of our jungle haven and the world of knowledge.
